I am an Economics PhD candidate at [Central European University](https://economics.ceu.edu), Budapest, Hungary and Vienna, Austria. I am interested in applied microeconomics in general. I especially like working on data-intensive projects that require creative data collecting and/or analyzing steps.

I also work as a research assistant at CEU Microdata group led by [Adam Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/) and [Miklos Koren](https://koren.mk) since 2017, where I mostly collect, maintain, and analyze large-scale datasets. I have experience in economic consulting as well.

I am a visiting doctoral researcher at [Erasmus School of Economics](https://ese.eur.nl) from September to December 2021.

You can find my latest CV [here](https://martonfleck.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
