I am an Economics PhD candidate at [Central European University](https://economics.ceu.edu), Budapest, Hungary, under the supervision of [Laszlo Matyas](https://people.ceu.edu/laszlo_matyas). I am interested in applied microeconomics in general. I especially like working on data-intensive projects that require creative data collecting and/or analyzing steps.

I also work at CEU Microdata group led by [Adam Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/) and [Miklos Koren](https://koren.mk) as a research assistant since 2017, where I mostly collect, maintain, and analyze large-scale datasets. I also have experience in economic consulting.
